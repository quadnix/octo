[Official Docs](http://octo.quadnix.com/)

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## Development
We have provided a few dummy implementation examples in the `src` directory to help you get started with Octo.
Feel free to replace them with your own implementation.

Once you are happy with your implementation and tests,
```bash
# Build app. This will compile your TypeScript code.
npm run build

# Test app.
npm run test
```
