# Octo Tests

## Test Variable Naming Convention
```
<variable><number1>_<number2>
```
where,
* `variable` is the name of the variable.
* `number1` starting from 0, are the different instances.
* `number2` starting from 0, is the total times this variable has been deserialized.
* If `number1` or `number2` does not exist, they are automatically assumed to be 0.
