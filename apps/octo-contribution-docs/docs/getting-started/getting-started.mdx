## Requirements
* **Node.js version** 16.0 or above.
  * However, documentation websites `apps/*-docs` run on docusaurus,
  which requires Node.js version to be `18.0` or above.
  * So, **Node.js version `18.0`** or above is recommended.
  * **`npm`** is the preferred package manager.
* **IDE**
  * Some developers prefer WebStorm, and some VSCode. There are other good options out there as well.
  As long as the quality of commits meets the minimum standard, choice of IDE is of no concern.
  * However, you will find more support for `WebStorm` in this documentation than any other IDE.

## Project Structure
<div class="layout_text_wrap_image">
  <img src={RootProjectStructure} height="600" />
  <div>
    This is the [root](https://github.com/quadnix/octo) of the project.
    Octo is a **monorepo**, i.e. all relevant files lives here.
    And we use **`nx`** as the base library to facilitate the monorepo.

    There is usually a huge debate between monorepo vs polyrepo, but after much consideration,
    we felt having all code in one location outweighs most of the cons, and enforces common standards,
    such as eslint, dictionary, and tsconfig, just to name a few.

    The repository, at first glance, might look huge, but really is just a collection of small packages and apps,
    all working independently, with their separate CICD pipelines and life cycles. They just live together,
    like a little family they are.

There is a lot to unpack here, but to get started here some important directories and files.
* `apps`: is where we currently house all the documentation websites. They are `docusaurus` projects,
i.e. React and Markdown files.
* `packages` is where you will find Octo's distributable packages.
  * `octo` is the base package.
  * `octo-aws-cdk` is our AWS implementation of Octo.
  * `octo-build` is the CLI tool to build Octo packages.
* `.eslintrc.cjs`: is the base EsLint file. We use EsLint to enforce code linting.
* `.prettierrc`: is the base Prettier file. We use Prettier to enforce code formatting.
* `dictionary.dic`: is the spell check file.
* Rest of the directories and files are not where you might spend much time.
They are still tersely discussed later in this documentation.

## Code Style & Guidelines
* We follow [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) for the entire project.
There are some minor differences where we deviate, but we expect to keep this list short.
  * Column limit (120): our lines can be 120 character long as opposed to 80. This applies to all files in this project.
* We keep anything sorted, where applicable, e.g. json files, object keys, configurations, etc.
* We enforce a spell checker via EsLint. If the word is not recognized, it must have an entry in dictionary.dic

## Documentation
The role of documentation in any organization cannot be overstated, and we are no exception.
We don't believe in great documentation, but we do expect to write documents consistently.
The idea behind two sets of documentation is to capture the feature documentation,
and also to capture the decisions leading up to the feature.

If our contributors and developers feels "lost" and don't understand the changes they are about to commit,
or how things work, then the documentation has failed them.

Another important factor to consider while documenting, is to keep the context in perspective.
The aim is to teach, and not to document.

## Testing
* We use `Jest` for writing tests. Unit, Integration, and E2E tests are supported.
* `packages/*` are covered with tests. Documentation websites don't have tests.
* We aim to test features, not lines of code. This might not mean 100% test coverage, which is okay.
The idea is if the implementation of a feature changes, the tests (apart from mocks) don't change.
