ðŸŽ‰ Welcome!!

We are excited for you to be here, and thank you for considering to contribute to Octo.
This documentation is dedicated to help you get started to make contributions and to not feel "lost".
Here you might find information on contribution guidelines, tech stack, project structure, and much more.

[//]: # (TODO: Insert Octo-Docs home page URL here.)
:::tip
Counterintuitively, you might not find much information on the internal workings of Octo here.
This documentation is solely dedicated to help make contributions, not to learn Octo itself.
<br />Though in order to make contributions, you need to understand the fundamentals of Octo,
and so if you haven't already, you should check out.
