We use `Git` as our version control tool, and `GitHub` as the UI.

## Commit Messages & PR
Because we are a monorepo, the GitHub space is shared with multiple projects.
We must take precaution while merging commits to ensure we understand which project we are talking about.

Individual commit messages don't matter, since the PR you create will be "Squash and Merge".
The `name` and `description` of the PR, however, must be properly formatted.

## Issues, Features, & Bug Tracking
* **TODO**: Create a TODO, as a comment, in code when the issue is small. It is something to remind yourself to do.
* **GitHub Issue**: Create a GitHub issue for large features, and bugs. This is where discussions will happen.
