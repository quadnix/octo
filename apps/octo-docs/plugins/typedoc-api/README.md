# typedoc-api

TypeDoc API is a custom docusaurus plugin to autogenerate API documentation from the Octo source code.
It is based on [docusaurus-plugin-typedoc-api](https://github.com/milesj/docusaurus-plugin-typedoc-api) package,
which is now deprecated. The original source code has been modified, customized, and improved to add features
suitable for the Octo documentation.

The code in this plugin is not as per the Octo standards,
but the aim is to be able to understand it better, and improve on it over time.
