title: Project Structure
---

## Introduction
A solid project structure is crucial for a successful and intuitive infrastructure.
While project structuring can vary based on personal preference and organization,
we highly recommend following our recommended patterns.

:::tip
At first the project structure may look unfamiliar, and overwhelming.
However, as you grasp the fundamentals in the next sections, all this should gradually make more sense.

:::info
Most files here are to set up TypeScript. If you are familiar with TypeScript projects,
you might be able to recognize some of the boilerplate code.

## Octo App Structure
An Octo app is an infrastructure implementation project in TypeScript.
This is where you apply templates, or import modules to define your overall infrastructure.

A typical Octo app, generated using the `create-app` command, will yield the following project structure.
```bash
npx @quadnix/octo-build create-app -t aws-s3-website -n test-app -p .
```
```
test-app                      # Root directory.
├── .env                      # Environment variables file.
├── .gitignore                # Git ignore file.
├── .octo                     # Octo state directory. This is where Octo will save the state of your infrastructure.
│   ├── .gitkeep              # Git keep file as a placeholder to keep the directory non-empty.
│   ├── models.json           # Serialized output of Models.
│   ├── resources-actual.json # Serialized output of actual Resources.
│   └── resources-old.json    # Serialized output of old Resources.
├── .prettierrc               # Prettier configuration file.
├── eslint.config.js          # ESLint configuration file.
├── package-lock.json         # Package lock file.
├── package.json              # Package configuration file.
├── README.md                 # README file.
├── src                       # Source directory.
│   ├── app.config.ts         # Application configuration file. Loads environment variables from .env file.
│   ├── main.ts               # Main entry point of the app.
│   └── module-definitions.ts # Module definitions file. Loads Octo modules.
│   └── octo.yaml             # Yaml Module definitions file. Loads Octo modules.
├── tsconfig.build.json       # TypeScript build configuration file.
├── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript configuration file.
└── website                   # Website directory containing HTML files (only for aws-s3-website template).
    ├── error.html            # Error page HTML file.
    └── index.html            # Index page HTML file.
```

:::info
Depending on how the specific template you are downloading is configured, the actual files may differ,
but this structure gives you a basic idea of what to expect.
:::

## Octo CDK Structure
An Octo CDK project is a TypeScript project to define custom Octo components.
This is where you develop new templates, modules, models, and resources for others to consume.

A typical Octo CDK, generated using the `create-cdk` command, will yield the following project structure.
```bash
npx @quadnix/octo-build create-cdk -n test-cdk -p . -o withExamples=false
```
```
test-cdk                      # Root directory.
├── .gitignore                # Git ignore file.
├── .prettierrc               # Prettier configuration file.
├── eslint.config.js          # ESLint configuration file.
├── package-lock.json         # Package lock file.
├── package.json              # Package configuration file.
├── README.md                 # README file.
├── src                       # Source directory.
│   ├── anchors               # Anchor directory.
│   │   └── .gitkeep
│   ├── factories             # Factory directory.
│   │   └── .gitkeep
│   ├── modules               # Module directory.
│   │   └── .gitkeep
│   ├── resources             # Resource directory.
│   │   └── .gitkeep
│   └── utilities             # Utility directory.
│       └── .gitkeep
├── tsconfig.build.json       # TypeScript build configuration file.
└── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript configuration file.
```

:::tip
The CDK project structure is not so different from the app's structure by design.
Both are set up to configure TypeScript with minor differences in EsLint rules, and other TypeScript settings.

Our recommendation is to start with a pre-built template, and enhance it to add custom components as required.

## Types of Library
Octo is a large framework built with many smaller libraries.
The source code of these libraries exist in [GitHub](https://github.com/quadnix/octo), which is a NX monorepo.

### octo
This is the base library. It defines the base model and resource nodes, transaction capabilities,
and other essential constructs required for Octo to run.
It is a really lightweight, zero dependency library. It is cloud-agnostic, and it exports classes
required for nearly all Octo operations.

### octo-aws-cdk
This is an extension of the base octo library - specific for AWS resources.
It defines several modules, models, overlays, anchors, and resources to encapsulate several of AWS resources.
You already saw an example with S3 website module imported from this library,
which encapsulates creating a S3 website with different parameters.

This is but one of the many community modules available to you.
Any one can write new modules, for any cloud provider.
Create your own custom modules in your own CDK. Share, reuse, publish, or use locally.

### octo-build
This is Octo's CLI tool. It offers several commands ranging from generating boilerplate code,
to running Octo's YAML definitions, and state manipulation.

### octo-event-listeners
This package is dedicated and scoped for logging and report generation only.
It listens and subscribes to several of Octo's events to emit logs and output HTML reports post transaction.

### octo-templates
This package houses some of the curated templates offered by Octo to help you get started faster.
Reference them as examples, or copy and customize them to set up the same infrastructure for yourself.

These templates are pre-built, pre-tested collection of modules,
serving some of the most common use cases we came across the community.
