title: Hello World!

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

No introduction is complete without a classic hello world program.
And what better way to say hi other than a simple "hello world" project.
Let's dive in and create the simplest possible infrastructure in Octo - a static website!

### Create a new App
Octo supports Templates - pre-configured and pre-tested infrastructure to help you get started fast.
You can start with one of the many templates provided by Octo and customize it accordingly,
or create a new one from scratch.

```bash
# Create a new directory "test-app" in current directory,
# and set up a new Octo app using the "aws-s3-website" template.
npx @quadnix/octo-build create -t aws-s3-website -n test-app -p .

# Enter the "test-app" directory.
cd test-app

# Initialize the Octo app.
npm install
```

### Directory structure
Above command generates the following directory structure.
If you have worked with TypeScript projects before, this should be very familiar to you.

All non-src files are to set up TypeScript, and you can customize them as per your needs.

```
test-app/                     # Root directory.
|── .gitignore                # Git ignore file.
|── .prettierrc               # Prettier configuration file.
├── eslint.config.js          # ESLint configuration file.
├── package-lock.json         # Package lock file.
├── package.json              # Package configuration file.
├── README.md                 # README file.
├── src                       # Source directory.
│   ├── .env                  # Environment variables file.
│   ├── .octo                 # Octo state directory. This is where Octo will save the state of your infrastructure.
│       ├── .gitkeep          # Git keep file as a placeholder to keep the directory non-empty.
│   ├── app.config.ts         # App configuration file. Loads environment variables from .env file.
│   ├── main.ts               # Main entry point of the app.
│   ├── module-definitions.ts # Module definitions file. Loads Octo modules.
│   └── website               # Website directory containing HTML files.
│       ├── error.html        # Error page HTML file.
│       └── index.html        # Index page HTML file.
├── tsconfig.build.json       # TypeScript build configuration file.
└── tsconfig.json             # TypeScript configuration file.
```

### Customizing the App
You will first need to modify below files before you can run the app.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Environment File" label="Environment File" default>
    ```shell title=".env"
    # Fix me: AWS account ID.
    AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=123456789123

    # Fix me: S3 bucket name.
    AWS_S3_WEBSITE_BUCKET_NAME=my-website-unique-bucket
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Running the App
```bash
# Compile the app.
npm run build

# Run the app.
npm run start:dev
```

### Testing the App
Modify and visit these URLs to ensure the website is up and running.
```bash
http://<my-bucket-name>.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html
http://<my-bucket-name>.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/error.html
```

### What just happened?
You created your first infrastructure using Octo!
You ran some pre-built modules imported in `module-definitions.ts` that creates and sets up a static website in AWS S3.

Octo ran these modules, and saved the state of all models and resources that got created in the `.octo` directory!
These represent the state of your infrastructure.
Do not modify or delete these files. If you wish, inspect the file and get familiar with its structure.
```
models.json
resources.json
<my-bucket-name>-manifest.json
```

:::note
If you run the app again, it would use the state files to detect that the website already exists,
and won't do anything.
If you were to edit the HTML files and re-run the app, Octo would detect these changes based on the state files,
and will re-upload the changed files to the S3 bucket.
:::

Hopefully, this example demonstrated you the benefits of Octo!
You were able to accomplish your infrastructure needs using Octo's abstracted components,
without having the need to understand or implement the low level details of the resources involved.
You can inspect the state files and logs to understand the cloud resources created by Octo.

### Cleaning Up (Optional)
To clean up all the resources created thus far, modify the `module-definitions.ts`.
Comment out all modules except the `app` and `account` modules.
The app and account modules load AWS credentials to call AWS APIs, hence they remain uncommented.

By deleting the `s3-website-service-module` module below,
you are deleting the s3-website resources created by this module.

```typescript
private init(): void {
  this.add(SimpleAppModule, 'app-module', { name: 'aws-s3-website' });

  this.add(AwsIniAccountModule, 'account-module', {
    accountId: config.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID,
    app: stub<App>('${{app-module.model.app}}'),
  });

  // *************************
  // Comment out below module.
  // *************************

  // this.add(AwsS3StaticWebsiteServiceModule, 's3-website-service-module', {
  //   account: stub<Account>('${{account-module.model.account}}'),
  //   awsRegionId: 'us-east-1',
  //   bucketName: config.AWS_S3_WEBSITE_BUCKET_NAME,
  //   directoryPath: websiteSourcePath,
  // });
}
```

Then, simply re-build and run your app again.
```bash
npm run build
npm run start:dev
```

Now you can just delete the Octo directory and all the code in it.
```console
rm -Rf test-app
```

### Summary
In this comprehensive guide, we hosted a simple website with just a few lines of code.
Next, we will delve into every detail of how it all worked and explore further possibilities with Octo.
