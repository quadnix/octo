## Requirements
* **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js version 16.0 or above installed.
You can verify the installed version by running `node -v`.
If needed, you can use nvm for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine.
* **AWS Account**: In this example we are building an infrastructure on AWS.
You'll need an AWS account. [[1]](#footnotes)

## New Project
1. Create a new project.
```sh
mkdir octo-starter-project
cd octo-starter-project
```

2. Create a new `package.json` file. [[2]](#footnotes)
```json title="package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {},
  "name": "octo-starter-project",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

## Installation
Octo comprises a collection of npm packages,
including the foundational `octo` library and our customized implementation for various Cloud Providers.
Currently, only AWS is supported through the `octo-aws-cdk` library.

To install these libraries,
```sh
npm install @quadnix/octo @quadnix/octo-aws-cdk --save-prod
```

## Hello World
We are going to host a very simple website.

1. Create some website files.
```html title="website/index.html"
<html lang='en'>
<head>
  <title>My First Website</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hey! Look at me! This is my first website!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
```html title="website/error.html"
<html lang='en'>
<head>
  <title>Oh No!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is an error!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

2. Write your first Octo code. This will host your HTML files in a website backed by a S3 bucket.
:::info
In below script, change `<my-bucket-name>` with a bucket name of your choice that is available in S3.
:::
```js title="main.js"
import { App, LocalStateProvider } from '@quadnix/octo';
import { OctoAws, RegionId, S3StaticWebsiteService } from '@quadnix/octo-aws-cdk';
import { dirname, join } from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
const BUCKET_NAME = '<my-bucket-name>';
const websiteSourcePath = join(__dirname, 'website');

const octoAws = new OctoAws();
await octoAws.initialize(new LocalStateProvider(__dirname));

// Add website.
const app = new App('test');
const service = new S3StaticWebsiteService(RegionId.AWS_US_EAST_1A, BUCKET_NAME);
app.addService(service);

const diffs1 = await octoAws.diff(app);
const generator1 = await octoAws.beginTransaction(diffs1);

const modelTransactionResult1 = await generator1.next();
await octoAws.commitTransaction(app, modelTransactionResult1.value);

// Add files to website.
await service.addSource(`${websiteSourcePath}/error.html`);
await service.addSource(`${websiteSourcePath}/index.html`);

const diffs2 = await octoAws.diff(app);
const generator2 = await octoAws.beginTransaction(diffs2);

const modelTransactionResult2 = await generator2.next();
await octoAws.commitTransaction(app, modelTransactionResult2.value);
```

## Running & Testing Hello World
1. Run the script.
```sh
node main.js
```

2. Modify and visit these URLs and ensure the website is up and running.
```
http://<my-bucket-name>.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html
http://<my-bucket-name>.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/error.html
```

3. Notice few files are auto-generated. These represent the state of your infrastructure. Do not delete these files.
```
models.json
resources.json
shared-resources.json
<my-bucket-name>-manifest.json
```

:::tip[Need help ?]
If the script didn't work out, see what you can do [[3]](#footnotes).
:::

## Cleaning Up (Optional)
To clean up all the resources created thus far, simply modify the script to remove all models.
```js title="main.js"
import { App, LocalStateProvider } from '@quadnix/octo';
import { OctoAws } from '@quadnix/octo-aws-cdk';
import { dirname } from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));

const octoAws = new OctoAws();
await octoAws.initialize(new LocalStateProvider(__dirname));

const app = new App('test');

const diffs1 = await octoAws.diff(app);
const generator1 = await octoAws.beginTransaction(diffs1);

const modelTransactionResult1 = await generator1.next();
await octoAws.commitTransaction(app, modelTransactionResult1.value);
```

Once you ensure all resources are deleted, you can just delete the directory and the code in it.

```sh
rm -Rf octo-starter-project
```

## Summary
In this comprehensive guide, we hosted a simple website with just a few lines of code.
Next, we will delve into every detail of how it all worked and explore further possibilities with Octo.

## Footnotes
- [1] If you are having trouble setting up AWS,
<Link display="this blog post" id="blog" path="/aws-local-setup" /> might help.
- [2] Octo exclusively supports ESM modules, requiring ``"type": "module"`` in package.json.
In <Link display="this blog post" id="blog" path="/octo-in-cjs" />, we explore using Octo with CJS modules.
- [3] If the script didn't work out, please open an issue using links at the bottom of this page.
