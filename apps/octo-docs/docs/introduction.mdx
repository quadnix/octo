**Octo is a cloud agnostic general purpose cloud infrastructure modeling and management tool.**

Hello, and welcome to Octo ❤️<br />
Octo is a set of libraries that can help you model and maintain your infrastructure as code.
The libraries are TypeScript based, and follows a similar modular pattern as Angular or NestJs.

Octo has the capability to support multiple Cloud Providers,
though today it only provides limited support for AWS.
As our community will grow, we expect to expand Octo's capabilities to other providers such as GCP, and Azure.

There are many IaC tools - Terraform, AWS CDK, Pulumi, and others.
But Octo is different from its peers, and is built from ground up.<br/>
While other IaC tools interface with cloud resources directly,
Octo introduces the concept of **Models** - a set of higher order encapsulation of cloud resources that are
easy and more natural to understand.<br/>
On top of Models, we introduce another concept called **Modules** - an even higher order of encapsulation than
Models, which allows you to define and share infrastructure plug-and-play components which makes your infrastructure
even easier to conceptualize.


The former allows you to
But enough with the boring technical jargon! Let’s talk real life:
keeping cloud stuff running smoothly nowadays is like herding caffeinated cats on a hot tin roof.
It’s so complex that companies are basically handing the keys over to their own personal army of DevOps wizards
just to keep the digital wheels from falling off.

With time, to manage infrastructure, slowly the concept of "Infrastructure as Code (IaC)" emerged -
set of libraries, and technologies specifically designed to manage infrastructure using code.
It has numerous benefits, such as versioning of infrastructure, git blame, logic, and sanity!

But IaC brought its own set of challenges, especially for traditional developers,
who are now expected to utilize CDKs (basically libraries) to self-serve their infrastructure needs,
while DevOps continue to manage lower-level infrastructure details and base CDK libraries.

Existing CDKs are primarily tailored for devops, posing challenges for developers.
Their development background often doesn't align seamlessly with Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
Here's why:
- Developers are tasked with understanding numerous low-level infrastructure details,
yet staying abreast of base CDK development can be challenging, resulting in knowledge gaps.
- DevOps frequently update base CDKs, leading to the adoption of new code without comprehensive context.
- This process often entails learning a new language or tech stack, adding to the complexity.

Octo aims to bridge the gap between devops and developers by offering familiar constructs understood by both groups.
These constructs are implemented as classes in TypeScript, catering specifically to JavaScript/TypeScript developers.

## Overview
Octo is a tool for modeling cloud infrastructure.
It helps devops make base CDKs with easy-to-use features, called <Link id="model" />.
These features then turn into devops-friendly ones, called <Link id="resource" />,
and are used to build real infrastructure with Cloud APIs.

```mermaid
graph LR;
  developer[[Developer written CDK]] --> model((Models));
  model --> resource((Resources));
  resource --> cloudApi[[Native Cloud API calls]];
  cloudApi --> infrastructure[[Real Infrastructure]];
```

This setup cleanly divides responsibilities between devops and developers.
Devops create Models for developers to interact with the infrastructure.
Octo converts these Models into Resources,
which devops understand well and are better at representing the cloud infrastructure.
Then, Resources utilize Cloud APIs to manage the actual infrastructure.

## Example
Here's a simplified code of a **"Backend server running in QA environment"** in AWS infrastructure.

:::note
By "simplified" we mean we've intentionally left out some details for clarity.
:::

```typescript
const app = new App('my-app');

const region = new AwsRegion(AwsRegionId.AWS_US_EAST_1A);
app.addRegion(region);

const environment = new Environment('QA');
region.addEnvironment(environment);

const server = new Server('Backend');
app.addServer(server);

const deployment = new Deployment('v1');
server.addDeployment(deployment);

new Execution(deployment, environment);
```

* `App`, `Environment`, `Execution`, etc are all Models.
* Developers interact with Models which is represented by the Model graph (below).
* Models are transformed to Resources which logically represents the AWS infrastructure (below).
* Resources are transformed to AWS infrastructure using native AWS APIs.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  subgraph Resources
    vpc((<b>VPC</b>)) --> subnet((<b>Subnet</b> <br> us-east-1a))
    subnet --> ecs((<b>ECS Cluster</b> <br> QA))
    ecs --> service((<b>ECS Service</b>))
    taskDefinition((<b>Task Definition</b> <br> Backend)) --> service
  end

  subgraph Models
    app((<b>App</b>)) --> region((<b>Region</b> <br> us-east-1a));
    app --> server((<b>Server</b> <br> Backend));
    region --> environment((<b>Environment</b> <br> QA));
    server --> deployment((<b>Deployment</b> <br> v1));
    environment --> execution((<b>Execution</b> <br> v1_qa));
    deployment --> execution;
  end
```

## Benefits
* **Modeling Power**: Octo excels as a general-purpose cloud infrastructure modeling tool,
making modeling its greatest strength. By facilitating devops in creating clear and intuitive CDKs,
developers can logically write and test infrastructure changes.
* **Abstraction for Developers**: Developers are shielded from intricate low-level infrastructure details,
interacting solely with Models.
* **TypeScript Advantage**: Being written in TypeScript, Octo inherits the benefits of TS,
including testing frameworks and the familiarity of one of the most widely used languages.
* **Graph Representation**: Octo depicts infrastructure as a Graph,
enabling visualization of infrastructure as a well-defined set of nodes and edges.
* **Detailed Understanding of Changes**: Any alterations to the infrastructure graph are differentially analyzed
at both Model and Resource levels, offering developers both simplified and detailed insights into the proposed changes.
* **Transactional Support**: Octo provides Transactions, allowing unit changes to the infrastructure graph,
with the capability to revert to a previous state in the event of errors.
