## Introduction
Module in Octo refers to a collection of Models come together to form a cohesive unit of higher order infrastructure.

:::info
Modules is how you define your IaC repository.
Within modules you mix models, which in turn generates resources, which generates infrastructure.
:::

:::tip
Modules are shareable, which is an incredibly powerful feature.
It supports isolated "infrastructure plugins" that you can simply import to enhance your infrastructure.
:::

## Example
Modules are classes annotated with a `@Module()` decorator, and implements the `IModule<T>` interface.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [RegionModule],
})
export class EnvironmentModule implements IModule<Environment> {
  constructor(private readonly region: Region) {}

  async onInit(): Promise<Environment> {
    const environment = new Environment('qa');
    this.region.addEnvironment(environment);
    return environment;
  }
}
```

In this example, we create an EnvironmentModule that imports the RegionModule.
It is not important for the EnvironmentModule to know how a region is created,
except that the RegionModule returns a `Region` which the EnvironmentModule is injected with.
The EnvironmentModule then manipulates models, and returns the model it promised to return.

## Module Imports

```mermaid
graph TD;
  module1(Module 1)
  module2(Module 2)
  module3(Module 3)
  module4(Module 4)
  module5(Module 5)

  module1 -- imports --> module2;
  module1 -- imports --> module3;
  module3 -- imports --> module4;
  module3 -- imports --> module5;
```

Modules supports hierarchy, which means you can import other modules,
which in turn can import more modules.
Registration and execution of these modules happens exactly as you might expect -
with imported modules being executed first.

## Hooks
Modules support hooks - a sequence of callbacks triggered before or after specific events.
You can register for these transaction events within the module to execute custom code.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="CommitHooks" label="Commit Hooks" default>
    Pre/Post Commit Hooks allows you to take an action before or after the entire transaction is committed.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ModelHooks" label="Model Hooks" default>
    Pre/Post Model Hooks allows you to take an action before or after a model action runs.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ResourceHooks" label="Resource Hooks" default>
    Pre/Post Resource Hooks allows you to take an action before or after a resource action runs.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Example

```typescript
@Module({
  postModelActionHooks: [
    {
      ACTION_NAME: 'AddRegionModelAction',
      handle: async (diff: Diff, actionInputs: ActionInputs, actionOutputs: ActionOutputs): Promise<ActionOutputs> => {
        // Manipulate some resources.

        // Return the final output.
        return actionOutputs;
      }
    }
  ]
})
export class EnvironmentModule implements IModule<Environment> {
  // ...
}
```

In this example, the EnvironmentModule is registering a hook into the "AddRegionModelAction" event.
It triggers after this action has run, and before the next action.

:::info
Hooks enhances/extends the functionality of Actions.
:::

### Order of Execution
Hooks are bound to Modules, and since modules have an hierarchy, hook registration follows that hierarchy.

```mermaid
graph TD;
  module1("Module 1")
  module2("Module 2")
  hook1{{"Hook 1"}}
  hook2{{"Hook 2"}}
  hook3{{"Hook 3"}}
  addRegionEvent(["AddRegionModelAction"])
  addEnvironmentEvent(["AddEnvironmentModelAction"])

  module1 -- "imports" --> module2
  module1 --> hook1
  hook1 -- postHook --> addRegionEvent
  module1 --> hook2
  hook2 -- postHook --> addEnvironmentEvent
  module2 --> hook3
  hook3 -- postHook --> addRegionEvent
```

In above diagram, hooks of "Module 2" are registered before "Module 1".<br />
The resulting order of execution post "AddRegionModelAction" event would be - `[Hook 3, Hook 1]`<br />
The resulting order of execution post "AddEnvironmentModelAction" event would be - `[Hook 2]`

## Summary
We discussed Modules and Hooks.
Modules unify models into cohesive infrastructure units.
It supports hierarchical imports and customizable hooks for enhanced transactional control.
