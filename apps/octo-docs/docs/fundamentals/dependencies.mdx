## Introduction
A dependency is the edge between two nodes that describes their relationship. It can be one of three types,
* **Parent**
<br/> A node is the parent of another node, meaning it must exist before the child node is created.
For example, an app is the parent of a region, so the app must exist before any region is created.
* **Child**
<br /> A node is the child of another node, meaning it will be deleted before the parent node is deleted.
For example, an environment is a child of a region, so all environments must be deleted before deleting the region.
* **Relationship**
<br /> A node has a relationship with another node that is neither a parent nor a child relationship.
For example, a server has a relationship with an image.
The distinction between the "relationship" type and the "parent-child" type is that in a "relationship",
there is no obligation for either node to exist or be deleted before of the other node.

:::tip
* A parent-child dependency is bi-directional, i.e. if Node 1 is parent of Node 2,
then Node 2 must be a child of Node 1.
* A "Relationship" dependency is also bi-directional, i.e. if Node 1 has relationship with Node 2,
then Node 2 also has a relationship with Node 1.

## Node
A node in Octo can be - a Model, a Resource, a Shared-Resource, or an Overlay.<br />
In Octo code base, a node is represented with any child of `AModel<I, T>`,
which is the base abstract class that Model, Resource, Shared-Resource, and Overlay inherit from.

:::info
The base class `AModel` is not to be confused with its concrete implementation `Model` class.
The former is a low level implementation detail, vs the latter is a concrete concept.
:::

## Dependency Class
A dependency is not stored as a property in nodes; instead, it is its own class.
It encompasses two nodes on its either end.

```js title="Dependency Schema"
{
  from: "a node",
  to: "a node",
  relationship: "parent | child | relationship",
  behaviors: "an array of metadata with individual traits of this dependency."
}
```

A dependency is also serialized and deserialized like models and resources.
<br />It is a first class citizen of Octo.

## Summary
In a graph there are vetices and edges.
In this section we learned that a Dependency represents an edge,
and is stored as a first class citizen of Octo.
