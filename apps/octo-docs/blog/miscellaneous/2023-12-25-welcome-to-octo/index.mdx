## Our Mission
Now, here is a song to summarize why we started Octo.
Hope you find it as silly as we do 😂

:::info[&nbsp;&nbsp;🎵 🎤 The Octo song, that you can't help but sing along! 💃 🕺]
<i>
We have a song, that we like to sing
<br/>We wanna help, because that's our thing

We saw some devs, struggling to go to prod
<br/>If you too have this issue, just blink or nod

So here's the problem, infrastructure is complicated
<br/>And whatever we learn, quickly becomes deprecated

So we thought, let infrastructure be smart
<br/>Give it some code, let it figure the how and the what

That's why we created Octo, a service that understands
<br/>It can manage your application, without sweating its pants

So come on now, send us a ping
<br/>And do not delay, because this is the NEXT BIG THING!
