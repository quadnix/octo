Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to <Brand/>'s blog posts.
We believe sharing is caring, and this is our medium to share everything we know <Brand/> and beyond.

Here you might find all sorts of technical articles, such as examples demonstrating <Brand/>'s features,
or articles that makes your lives easy to jump to <Brand/> as smoothly as possible,
or even topics that we find interesting.

:::note
Most subjects we write on are technical, and though we intend to write good quality articles,
our knowledge has gaps, and sometimes we can't fact check everything.
We are a community driven company, so please feel free to point out our mistakes
using the "Edit this page" links at the bottom of every page.

Now, here is a song to summarize why we started <Brand/>.
Hope you find it as silly as we do ðŸ˜‚

:::info[ðŸŽµ ðŸŽ¤ The <Brand/> song, that you can't help but sing along! ðŸ’ƒ ðŸ•º]
<b>
We have a song, that we like to sing
<br/>We wanna help, because that's our thing

We saw some devs, struggling to go to prod
<br/>If you too have this issue, just blink or nod

So here's the problem, infrastructure is complicated
<br/>And whatever we learn, quickly becomes deprecated

So we thought, let infrastructure be smart
<br/>Give it some code, let it figure the how and the what

That's why we created <Brand/>, a service that understands
<br/>It can manage your application, without sweating its pants

So come on now, send us a ping
<br/>And do not delay, because this is the next big thing!
