Have you ever wanted to deploy a website to AWS but felt overwhelmed by the complexity of setting up infrastructure?
What if I told you that you could create and deploy a fully functional static website to AWS S3 in just a few minutes,
with minimal configuration and zero infrastructure expertise?

In this tutorial, we'll walk through creating your first website using **Octo** -
a powerful infrastructure-as-code framework that abstracts away the complexity of cloud resources.
By the end of this guide,
you'll have a live website running on AWS and understand how Octo makes infrastructure management surprisingly simple.

## What We'll Accomplish
Today, we're going to:
- **Create a static website** using Octo's pre-built templates
- **Deploy it to AWS S3** with just a few commands
- **Understand how Octo manages infrastructure state** automatically
- **Learn to clean up resources** when you're done

The best part? You don't need to be an AWS expert or infrastructure guru. Octo handles all the heavy lifting for you.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive in, make sure you have the basics covered.
If you haven't already, check out our [installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) to set up:
- **Node.js** (version 22.x or higher)
- **AWS CLI** (version 2.x or higher) with your credentials configured

Once you're all set up, we're ready to create some magic! ✨

## Step 1: Create Your First Octo App
Let's start by creating a new Octo application.
Octo comes with several pre-configured templates that make getting started incredibly easy.
For our website, we'll use the `aws-s3-website` template.

Open your terminal and run these commands:
```bash
# Create a new directory "my-awesome-website" in your current location
# and set up a new Octo app using the "aws-s3-website" template
npx @quadnix/octo-build create-app -t aws-s3-website -n my-awesome-website -p .

# Navigate into your new project
cd my-awesome-website

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

That's it! Octo has just scaffolded a complete project structure for you.
If you're curious about what was created,
you can explore the [Octo App Structure](/docs/getting-started/project-structure#octo-app-structure) documentation.

## Step 2: Configure Your Environment
Before we can deploy anything, we need to tell Octo about your AWS account and give your S3 bucket a unique name. 

Create or edit the `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
# Your AWS account ID (you can find this in your AWS console)
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=123456789123

# A unique bucket name for your website (S3 bucket names must be globally unique)
AWS_S3_WEBSITE_BUCKET_NAME=my-awesome-website-2024-unique
```

:::tip
Make sure your bucket name is unique! S3 bucket names are globally unique across all AWS accounts.

## Step 3: Deploy Your Website
Now for the exciting part - let's deploy your website! This is where Octo really shines.

```bash
# Build your Octo application
npm run build

# Deploy to AWS
npm start
```

Sit back and watch the magic happen! Octo will:
1. **Connect to your AWS account** using your configured credentials
2. **Create an S3 bucket** with the name you specified
3. **Configure the bucket** for static website hosting
4. **Upload your website files** to the bucket
5. **Generate a detailed report** of everything that was created

## Step 4: Visit Your Live Website
Once the deployment is complete, you'll see the URLs where your website is now live! Visit these URLs in your browser:

```bash
http://<your-bucket-name>.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html
http://<your-bucket-name>.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/error.html
```

Congratulations! 🎉 You've just deployed your first website to AWS without writing a single line of infrastructure code.

## What Just Happened? (The Magic Behind the Scenes)
You might be wondering: "How did Octo know what to create?" Here's what happened:

**Octo used pre-built modules** that were imported in your `module-definitions.ts` file.
These modules contain all the logic needed to create and configure an S3 static website.

**State management is automatic** - Octo saved the state of all resources it created in the `.octo` directory.
This includes:
- `models.json` - The logical models of your infrastructure
- `resources.json` - The actual AWS resources that were created
- `<your-bucket-name>-manifest.json` - A manifest of your specific deployment

:::tip[Smart Infrastructure Management]
If you run the app again, Octo will detect that your website already exists and won't recreate it.
If you modify your HTML files and re-run, Octo will intelligently detect the changes and only upload the modified files.
Pretty cool, right?
:::

## Understanding Your Infrastructure
One of Octo's best features is transparency.
You can always see exactly what resources were created by examining the state files in the `.octo` directory.
This gives you full visibility into your infrastructure without having to dig through AWS console screens.

## HTML Reports: Your Infrastructure Dashboard

After each deployment, Octo generates a beautiful HTML report showing exactly what changed in your infrastructure.
You'll find this report in your project root directory - simply open it in any web browser to see:
- What resources were created
- What resources were modified
- Any errors or warnings
- A complete audit trail of your deployment

This report is invaluable for understanding what Octo did and ensuring everything was deployed as expected.

## Cleaning Up (When You're Done Experimenting)
When you're ready to clean up your resources (and avoid any AWS charges), Octo makes it just as easy:

1. **Edit your `module-definitions.ts`** file
2. **Comment out the S3 website module** (keep the app and account modules)
3. **Rebuild and run** your app

```typescript
private init(): void {
  this.add(SimpleAppModule, 'app-module', { name: 'aws-s3-website' });
  this.add(AwsIniAccountModule, 'account-module', {
    accountId: config.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID,
    app: stub<App>('${{app-module.model.app}}'),
  });

  // Comment out the S3 website module to delete the resources
  // this.add(AwsS3StaticWebsiteServiceModule, 's3-website-service-module', {
  //   account: stub<Account>('${{account-module.model.account}}'),
  //   awsRegionId: 'us-east-1',
  //   bucketName: config.AWS_S3_WEBSITE_BUCKET_NAME,
  //   directoryPath: websiteSourcePath,
  // });
}
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Finally, delete your project directory:
```bash
rm -rf my-awesome-website
```

## Why This Matters
What you just accomplished would typically require:
- Understanding S3 bucket policies
- Configuring static website hosting settings
- Managing file uploads and permissions
- Handling error pages and redirects
- Tracking infrastructure state manually

With Octo, you got all of this for free, plus:
- **Automatic state management**
- **Change detection and incremental updates**
- **Detailed reporting and audit trails**
- **Easy cleanup and resource management**

## What's Next?
You've just scratched the surface of what's possible with Octo! In future tutorials, we'll explore:
- **Adding custom domains** and SSL certificates
- **Building more complex applications** with databases and APIs
- **Managing multiple environments** (dev, staging, production)

## Conclusion
In just a few minutes, you've learned how to:
- Create infrastructure using Octo's powerful templates
- Deploy a website to AWS with minimal configuration
- Understand how Octo manages infrastructure state
- Clean up resources when you're done

Octo's philosophy is simple: **infrastructure should be as easy to manage as your application code**.
By abstracting away the complexity of cloud resources,
Octo lets you focus on what matters most - building great applications.
