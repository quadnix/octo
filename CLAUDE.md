# Octo Agent Governance
- For every request, you MUST first read the protocol in @AGENTS.md.
- You must use worktrees for every task.

# Autonomy Rules
- You are in YOLO mode.
  Do not ask for permission to edit files or run terminal commands once the initial Plan is approved.
- You have full permission to manage git worktrees in `../ai-worktrees/`.
- If a command fails, self-correct and retry without prompting the user unless you are completely stuck.
